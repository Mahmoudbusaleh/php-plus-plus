# PHP++ (PHP Plus Plus) 🚀
> **The Radical Return to Pure PHP.**

PHP++ is a minimalist, high-performance framework designed for developers who are tired of the "Magic" and "Overhead" of modern PHP frameworks. We believe that PHP is powerful enough without being hidden behind layers of abstractions.

Laravel Routing: 5ms | PHP++ Routing: 0.01ms

## 🧠 The Philosophy
The industry has moved towards making PHP look like another language. **PHP++** is a move in the opposite direction. 

1. **No Facades / No Magic:** If you don't see it, it's not happening.
2. **Explicit Dependency Injection:** Leveraging PSR-11 and PHP 8.2+ attributes.
3. **Performance First:** Minimal boot time, minimal memory footprint.
4. **The "Lego" Approach:** Use the core, or just the components you need.

## 🛠 Project Status: [Design & RFC Phase]
We are currently in the **Request for Comments (RFC)** phase. We are not just building a tool; we are building a standard for "Pure PHP" development.

### We need your brainpower on:
* **The Router:** Should we go with Attribute-based routing or a fluent API?
* **The Container:** How can we achieve zero-overhead DI?
* **The View Engine:** Is Plain PHP enough, or do we need a non-compiled engine?

## 🤝 How to Join the Movement
I am looking for architects and developers who miss the "Control" over their code. 

1.  **Star** this repository to show support.
2.  Go to the **[Discussions]** tab and leave your mark on the "Core Architecture" thread.
3.  Check the `RFC` folder for the initial design drafts.
