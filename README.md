## 🛣️ Native & Fast: The PHP++ Way

See how simple it is to get started. No magic, just pure PHP:

```php
require_once 'src/Router.php';
use PHPPlusPlus\Router;

// Defined like Native PHP, Executed like Machine Code
Router::get('/home', function() {
    return "<h1>Welcome to the PHP++ Revolution!</h1>";
});

// The Compiler handles the rest for maximum performance
Router::dispatch();

Built with passion, powered by the community. Let's make history together.
